# Blurred, Colorful Background

Depending on your brand or message, you might want to add a little flair to your site. If this is the case, blurred or gradient backgrounds are an excellent choice.

Not only are they eye-catching, but they also add more depth to your design and can even be used to simulate movement. When paired with powerful copy, this is an excellent way to grab your visitorâ€™s attention and keep them focused on your page.
