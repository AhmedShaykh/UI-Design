# Visible Borders

Web design likes to create a sense of magicâ€”or at least the illusion that the content is neatly arranged by an invisible hand, floating freeform in digital space. The reality, of course, is that websites are built on a strict grid and held together with code. For 2022, web designers are looking to get a little more real with layouts that reveal their foundation through simple borders and frames.

A visible grid has the obvious benefit of distinguishing one section from one another. This makes the page easier to scan while allowing for more content without the page feeling crowded. These simple borders also give websites a subtle, retro touch that pairs well with other 90s-adjacent trends making a comeback.


When creating a website design, developers and designers follow grids to make sure that everything on the web page is aligned and structured accordingly. These grids only serve as guides that explain why they disappear once the website is live.

However, websites in 2023 have been trending the bordered design. This website design trend showcases visible borders on the website page. Visitors can see the division and the alignment of the components of the web page.

The great advantage of this website design is that it distinguishes the sections of each page. It organizes the text and images and prevents overcrowding of content. It also makes it easier for visitors to scan through the page.
