# Serif Fonts

For many years web designers avoided serif fonts. These “fancier” fonts were seen as being less legible, especially on digital devices.

However, improved screen resolution and better online support for these fonts have led to serif fonts having a huge comeback. More designers are adopting fonts like Georgia, Garamond, and Didot to add a little flair to their websites.

If you’re still worried about readability, experiment with using serif fonts in your header while sticking with sans serif fonts for your body text.
