# Serif Fonts

Years ago, there were so many rules associated with the placement and usage of typography in design. But we’ve come so far from then and in 2022, there’s essentially no incorrect way of doing typography.

Even serifs, among some big bold fonts, can be seen everywhere and they look phenomenal!

For many years web designers avoided serif fonts. These “fancier” fonts were seen as being less legible, especially on digital devices.

However, improved screen resolution and better online support for these fonts have led to serif fonts having a huge comeback. More designers are adopting fonts like Georgia, Garamond, and Didot to add a little flair to their websites.

If you’re still worried about readability, experiment with using serif fonts in your header while sticking with sans serif fonts for your body text.

In contrast to the harshness that revolved around the use and placement of typography years ago, the opportunities you have today are seemingly endless. In 2022, there’s no wrong way to do typography. Big bold fonts — even serifs — are everywhere. And they look fantastic.
