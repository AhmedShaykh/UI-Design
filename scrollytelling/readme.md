# Storytelling with scroll-triggered animation

Do you want to take your users on an amazing, profound journey that kicks them off ground and makes them fall in love with your brand, product, or services? Of course, you do.

In 2022, it’s simply not enough to just place information on your app and web pages. What you need is the art of ‘Scrollytelling’. Scrolling + Storytelling. This is the ultimate collaboration of narration and design aesthetics to walk your users through an engaging experience. 

In scrollytelling, the narrative consists of illustrations, fonts, and text snippets to tell a visual story. With each scroll, a new animation or object, or even a block of text may pop up. 

The most common scrollytelling you can see is on [Apple](https://www.apple.com/in/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-14) and [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s22-ultra/)’s websites.
